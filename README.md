# React component: input with autocomplete

## Installing and starting server

1. npm install
2. npm start

## Goal - qualities of the codebase

1. As extensible as possible
2. DRY
3. Documented

## How I incrementally approached the problem

1. Managing to console log what is entered in my input
2. Writing what I input in a li element of the ul
3. Comparing the input with country entries
